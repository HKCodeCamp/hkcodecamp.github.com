# Hong Kong Code Camp

A 24 hour hackathon

## The Concept

Hong Kong Code Camp is for *coders* of any kind

Whether you work in a bank, a hot startup, or you're still studying, you are welcome.

# The Plan

## Before the Event

Think!
We need your ideas for what to build on the day.

Projects can be anything, but you should bear these things in mind;

1. You only have 24 hours, so try to break it down to the minimum.
   Its good to aim to get something working by halfway, and spend the second half making it awesome.

2. Teams will be 4 to 6 people.
   A good idea will be easy to break up into chunks.
   Maybe one person builds the iOS app, another makes it look good.
   Maybe one person does the server-side API, and another does facebook integration.

3. Choose technologies you know.
   While its always fun to try out new tools,
   finishing a project in 24 hours is difficult enough using a language or framework you know well. You don't want to hit.

   If you want to try something new, dedicate a weekend before to play with it.
   And come to Code Camp ready to push it to the max.

So get thinking before the event, and come to the Idea Factory ready to show off your great ideas.

## Wednesday Night Idea Factory

The *Idea Factory* is like the whole of Startup Weekend crammed into one evening.

1. Idea Generation

The evening starts at about 7pm.
We go round the room throwing out ideas and writing them on the board.
Everyone votes on their favourite idea and eventually we boil it down to a shortlist.
Each participant then chooses a project to work on.
At the end (with  bit of diplomacy) everyone will be on a team doing something they like. And each team will have a good mixture of skills.

2. Team Planning

The rest of the evening is spent together as a team.
The aim is to finalise the idea, choose a technology stack, and start doing some research.
