# The Schedule

Hong Kong Code Camp runs slightly different to your usual hackathon.

We know 24 hours isn't enough time to throw a team together, decide on an idea, and then create it.

But we also know that weekends are precious.

## Hong Kong Code Camp is a 24 Hour Hackathon, with 48 Hours of preparation before hand

# Wednesday Night - Idea Factory

Hong Kong Code Camp kicks off on Wednesday evening.

Everyone is encouraged to contribute an idea.

We then vote on our favourite ideas and, after a bit of diplomacy, the teams are formed.

The rest of the evening is spent in teams, finalising their idea, and deciding how to go about preparing for the weekend.

At the end of the evening each team fills out a form with the following things

- A team name
- a list of members of the team
- a description of what they're going to build
- the technology they're going to use

# Thursday and Friday - Preparation

Hong Kong Code Camp is about having fun, and building cool stuff, in a limited amount of time.

We realise there's no point spending 2 of your 24 hours setting up a server, or doing boilerplate code.

So design, a skeleton application, setting up infrastructure, all of this can happen before the weekend.

# Friday Night until Saturday Night - 24 Hour Hackathon

On Friday night at about 7pm we all gather together, handout wifi passwords, plug in laptops, and everything starts.

Throughout the night and during the day there will be drinks and snacks provided by sponsors.

At key points during the event we will have a whole room standup.

Each team chooses a representative, and has 1 minute to let everyone know their team's status

- What they've just done
- What they're going to do next
- Any problems they've had

# Saturday Night - Finale & Dinner

At about 7pm on Saturday night, Hong Kong Code Camp reaches the finale.

Each team does a short presentation, showing off what they've built.

And finally we go get a well-earned dinner!
