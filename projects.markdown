# Projects

Projects for Hong Kong Code Camp can be anything, but you should bear these things in mind;

# You only have 24 hours
## Try to keep things simple

Its good to aim to get something working by halfway, and spend the second half making it awesome.

# Teams will be 4 to 6 people
## Build something you can split into pieces

A good idea will be easy to break up into chunks.
Maybe one person builds the iOS app, another makes it look good.
Maybe one person does the server-side API, and another does facebook integration.

# Don't try too many new things
## You don't have time to experiment too much

While its always fun to try out new tools,
finishing a project in 24 hours is difficult enough using a language or framework you know well.

If you want to try something new, dedicate a weekend before to play with it.
And come to Code Camp ready to push it to the max.

So get thinking before the event, and come to the Idea Factory ready to show off your great ideas.
